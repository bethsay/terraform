For the awscli to access our aws account, we need configure it with some credentials.
AccessKey and SecretAccessKey are required as credentials. Username and Password cannot be used.
--NEVER-- create AccessKey for your aws root account.
Create a new IAM user that has fullaccess in S3 and IAM. On your browser, access the portal at https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/create
    ->Step1 : Provide a name. UNcheck "access to the AWS Management Console"
    ->Step2 : Attach policies directly. Search for S3 and select the policy that grants fullaccess. Do the same for IAM
    ->Step3 : Review then "Create User"
From the users list, Select the user that you have created.
Go to the "Security Credentials" tab. Click on "Create access key". Go through the steps.
Download the .csv of your accesskey and secret to a safe location on your system. OR, you can copy the accesskey and secret into a temporary file and not save it.
Lets configure awscli with this access
    #aws configure help
    #aws configure import --csv file://aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
This command may fail, but can be fixed by editing the csv file
    #vim aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
        ->Prepend first line with "User Name"
        ->Prepend second line with "default" or with the username
    #aws configure import --csv file://aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
    #aws configure list-profiles
    #aws configure list
        #If you have not used "default", for this and every other awscli command, you must use the flag --profile=username
    #ls ~/.aws/
    #vim ~/.aws/credentials
This credentials file can hold any number of accesskeys and secrets. Each pair would be associated with a profilename/username
The only way to remove or delete any set of credentials is by editing this credentials file.
