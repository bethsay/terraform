For the awscli to access our aws account, we need configure it with some credentials.
AccessKey and SecretAccessKey are required as credentials. Username and Password cannot be used.
--NEVER-- create AccessKey for your aws root account.
Create a new IAM user that has fullaccess in S3 and IAM. On your browser, access the portal at https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/create
    ->Step1 : Provide a name. --uncheck-- "access to the AWS Management Console"
    ->Step2 : Attach policies directly. Search for S3 and select the policy that grants fullaccess. Do the same for IAM
    ->Step3 : Review then "Create User"
From the users list, Select the user that you have created.
Go to the "Security Credentials" tab. Click on "Create access key". Go through the steps.
Download the .csv of your accesskey and secret to a safe location on your system. OR, stay on the page until awscli config is done.
Ensure that the downloaded path is not a shared directory and is not a any type of repo.
Lets configure awscli with this access
    #aws configure help
    #aws configure
        ->Paste the accesskey and secret according to the prompts
        ->Enter the aws region from which is expected to have most operations
        ->Specify the format awscli shoud use while responding to queries, ie, json, text, or table
    #aws configure list
    #cat ~/.aws/config
    #cat ~/.aws/credentials
The accesskey, secret, region, output are now associated with the "default" profile.
Any number of accesskeys and secrets pairs can be configure under unique profilenames.
The only way to remove or delete any set of credentials is by editing this credentials file.
But you can overwrite the credentials of a profile by running the import command again.
If the accesskey and secrets was downloaded as a csv file, it can be used in the import command.
    #aws configure import --csv file://aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
This command may fail, but can be fixed by editing the csv file
    #vim aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
        ->Prepend first line with "User Name"
        ->Prepend second line with "default" or with the username
    #aws configure import --csv file://aws_userforiam_accessKeys.csv
    #aws configure list-profiles
    #aws configure list
        ->If you have not used "default", use the flag --profile=username
    #cat ~/.aws/credentials
To interactively set accesskeys and secrets for the profile foo
    #aws configure --profile foo

Lets verify if the credentials work. Lets list create and destroy an s3 bucket
    #aws s3 help
    #aws s3 ls
    #aws s3 mb "s3://mynewbucket-willwork"
        ->If default region was not configured, use the flag --region=us-east-1
You can check aws console if the bucket was created or not
    #aws s3 ls
    #aws s3 rb "s3://mynewbucket-willwork"
    #aws s3 ls
